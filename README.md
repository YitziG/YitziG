### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cardiological interfaces and API design for [iCardio.ai](icardio.ai). 
I am also spending lots of time on a top secret side-project that is going to make me rich! I can't say much more but here is it's current state: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/daf9bdd0-371b-4d55-8e67-dd314356ee76/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/heuristic-panini-1e3e7d/deploys)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js and video-chat technologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of art and technology.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
